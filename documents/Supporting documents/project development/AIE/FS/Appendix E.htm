      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This functional requirements 
      document describes sample procedures that potentially could assist 
      individuals who are planning, designing, and operating web sites that 
      include information about individual brownfields properties. With proper 
      design and operation, web sites have the potential to enhance the exchange 
      of information between sellers and buyers of brownfields properties at the 
      local, state, regional, and national levels. The sample procedures are 
      based on a web site design that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
      (EPA) developed as an optional design for consideration by those 
      individuals who currently are planning, designing or operating web sites 
      that list brownfields properties. The <A 
      href="http://www.cluin.org/products/bfproperty/web_design.htm">optional 
      design</A> is available on this site. The purpose of this functional 
      requirements document is to provide a general framework for a more 
      detailed set of procedures typically required to operate web sites. The 
      extent to which a more detailed set of procedures will be required for 
      each web site is dependant upon the complexity and operating parameters of 
      that web site.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A 
      name=background></A><B>BACKGROUND</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conjunction with its study 
      to assess the feasibility of establishing a national brownfields site 
      exchange web site, EPA met with potential buyers and sellers of 
      brownfields properties, as well as other national and local stakeholders, 
      to solicit their ideas and suggestions about how to operate such a web 
      site in order to best serve their needs. In general, many property owners 
      appear to be willing to provide information about their properties, but 
      lack the resources required to collect and assemble comprehensive 
      information and update it routinely. On the other hand, prospective buyers 
      of brownfields properties desire as much information as possible to 
      enhance their ability to screen properties and identify the properties 
      that best meet the buyers' criteria. On the basis of its discsussion with 
      brownfields stakeholders, observations of information that is currently 
      collected about brownfields properties, and information that is available 
      to the general public about listings of brownfields properties, EPA is 
      providing a suggested minimum set of information items that should be 
      present for a property in order to include that property in a web site 
      that lists brownfields properties for sale. Web site operators may have to 
      strike a balance in defining minimum information items for their systems.

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A 
      name=objectives></A><B>OBJECTIVES FOR WEB SITES THAT INCLUDE BROWNFIELDS 
      PROPERTIES </B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recognizing the broad range 
      of interests of potential users of web sites including brownfields 
      information, current initiatives underway to assemble information about 
      brownfields properties and the potential large volume of information to be 
      managed about properties, the following objectives should be considered in 
      the design of web sites that include information about brownfields 
      properties:</FONT></P>
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The web sites should allow 
        the public easy access to information about the properties 
        listed.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The web sites should 
        integrate data that already have been collected about the properties 
        listed.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The web sites should 
        provide direct links to other sources of information, including 
        independent databases.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The web sites should be 
        designed to minimize the amount of time required for the management and 
        updating of data and operation of the system.</FONT> </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A name=overview></A><B>2. 
      OVERVIEW OF WEB SITE OPERATING SYSTEMS</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary function of a web 
      site should be to allow users to easily search a database of brownfields 
      properties. The secondary function of a web site should be to allow users 
      to add or update the records in the database. This is an important 
      function for brownfields properties because; (1) the Brownfields Program 
      continues to grow and new properties are constantly being added to the 
      program, (2) properties need to be removed from the data base because they 
      are sold or for other reasons, (3) new information to characterize 
      contamination is being obtained as properties move through the site 
      assessment process, and (4) property owners continue to receive new 
      incentives to redevelop their properties and information about these 
      incentives should be communicated to potential purchasers. Other functions 
      that potentially could increase the utility of a web site are:</FONT></P>
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automatic e-mail 
        notification of registered users when new properties are added to the 
        database</FONT>

        system for administrative purposes</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automatic warning to data 
        providers by e-mail when property listings expire or when status updates 
        are needed</FONT>

        outdated property listings</FONT> </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A name=system></A><B>SYSTEM 
      PLATFORM AND INTERFACE</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A web site of brownfields 
      properties should be accessible to anyone who can log onto the World Wide 
      Web using a standard browser that is version 4.0 or higher. The inventory 
      of brownfields properties should be maintained in a relational database, 
      such as Oracle. A combination of standard HTML and a scripting language 
      for web application, such as Cold Fusion of MS Server Pages, should be 
      considered in developing the web page interfaces.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A name=layout></A><B>WEB 
      SITE LAYOUT AND DESIGN</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following diagram shows 
      the relationships between the pages that are included in the optional web 
      site design EPA prepared.</FONT></P>
      <P><IMG height=471 src="Appendix E_files/figure1.gif" width=710></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A name=homepage></A><B>HOME 
      PAGE</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The home page is the first 
      page that users see. The home page captures the attention of users, 
      including potential buyers and sellers of brownfields properties, cleanup 
      contractors, and other service providers. To provide visual continuity 
      between all pages, a banner graphic should appear at the top of each page, 
      and load quickly. The remaining space on the home page screen could be 
      filled with introductory text and hypertext links to other parts of the 
      web site. The home page may include success stories and discussions of 
      recent sales of brownfields properties. The page may show statistics, such 
      as the total number of properties currently in the database and the number 
      of new properties added during the past month.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A name=find></A>FIND 
      PROPERTIES FUNCTION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of building a 
      search should be simple and straightforward. The users should have the 
      ability to select search criteria from pick lists. Search criteria include 
      property location (city or county, state and Zip code), size of property, 
      ownership, zoning, available development incentives, and status of 
      environmental investigations. The search function should default to a 
      logic, such as Boolean, requiring that search results match all the 
      selected criteria (that is, criterion 1 AND criterion 2 AND criterion 3…). 
      The only exception might occur when the user selects more than one 
      incentive as criteria. The search function should find all sites that meet 
      one or more of the incentives selected (that is, incentive 1 OR incentive 
      2…).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the EPA optional design, 
      when a user initiates a database search by clicking the Submit button (see 
      <A 
      onclick="MM_openBrWindow('criteria.htm','criteria','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')" 
      href="http://www.cluin.org/products/bfproperty/appendixe.htm#">mockup of a 
      search page</A>), the next web page display lists all properties that 
      satisfy the user's criteria (see <A 
      onclick="MM_openBrWindow('results.htm','results','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')" 
      href="http://www.cluin.org/products/bfproperty/appendixe.htm#">mockup of 
      results page</A>). Properties are listed in a tabular format, with 
      separate columns for such essential data elements as state, zip code, 
      county, acreage, environmental status, and development incentives. The 
      default sort order of the tabular list is ascending, by city and then by 
      Zip code for cities that have a number of Zip codes. The user can click on 
      any column heading to sort the list by that column. To reduce loading time 
      for each page, the list is displayed in increments of 30 records per page. 
      Each property is assigned a unique record number to assist users in 
      searching for information. The record numbers are assigned sequentially as 
      new properties are listed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The user can view detailed 
      information about any of the brownfields properties shown in the summary 
      list. When the user clicks on a property record number in the summary 
      list, an overview of the property appears in a separate pop-up window (see 
      <A 
      onclick="MM_openBrWindow('detail2.htm','detail','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')" 
      href="http://www.cluin.org/products/bfproperty/appendixe.htm#">mockup of 
      detailed information for properties</A>). To compare properties side by 
      side, the user can open additional windows to facilitate side-by-side 
      comparison of properties.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The overview of the property 
      may include a direct link to another web site or another database that 
      provides more detailed information about the property. Links to other 
      sources of information can be accomplished through two programming 
      methods. The simplest method is to provide a link to the home page of a 
      data provider. In that case, it may be necessary that the user run another 
      search to find the information described. The second method is to link 
      directly into the database of the data provider. The user would have 
      immediate access to all available information; and no additional searching 
      would be <BR>necessary. The second method has obvious advantages for the 
      user, but it is much more complicated from a programming perspective. The 
      method requires a high level of cooperation between the operators of a web 
      site of brownfields properties and data providers. In many cases, 
      technical obstacles may make the second method impractical. The overview 
      of the property also may include a direct link to reports and studies 
      about the property that are available electronically, or provide 
      information on where these reports and studies can be found.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A 
      name=registration></A>REGISTRATION FUNCTION AND AUTOMATIC E-MAIL 
      NOTIFICATION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One step to increase user 
      interest in a brownfields property web site is to provide the capability 
      for users to receive e-mail notifications when new properties are added to 
      the database. This feature of the web site could be made available to 
      users who choose to register by entering contact information (name, 
      organization, and e-mail address). The e-mail notification process should 
      be automated. When a new web site is launched, users may be discouraged 
      from returning to the site if the initial number of properties listed is 
      small. The e-mail function will help to recapture users as new data are 
      added to the database. After the number of listings increases 
      significantly, the e-mail notification function can be modified to notify 
      users about new listings of properties that meet specific parameters 
      identified by the user. For example, the user could be notified only if a 
      property added to the database has characteristics that match the search 
      criteria previously established by the user.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A 
      name=dataproviders></A><B>DATA PROVIDERS (ADD/UPDATE 
      RECORDS)</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To add properties to the 
      database, data providers could be provided with options. The number and 
      types of options should be dependent upon the potential number of data 
      providers, whether the database will be local, state, regional, or 
      national, and the extent of quality control of the data. For example, the 
      following options might be appropriate for a state or national database: 
      </FONT></P>
      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use a web-based data entry 
        form. The data provider simply fills out the form on the web page. The 
        data are added to the database when the user clicks an "Update" button 
        at the bottom of the screen.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Download a copy of the web 
        site's data structure in an MS Access format. A simple user guide (one 
        or two pages) providing technical guidelines for either a novice user or 
        a database specialist could be prepared and made available for 
        downloading along with the MS Access database. After all data have been 
        transferred into the MS Access database, the data provider sends the MS 
        Access database back to the operator of the web site by e-mail or file 
        transfer protocol (FTP). The option allows the data provider to complete 
        the file when convenient and to generate their own copy of the 
        information provided.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Submit large volumes of 
        data in digital format, such as MS Access or ASCII comma delimited. The 
        data could then be imported into the database for the web site.</FONT> 
        </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help ensure data quality 
      and security, each data provider should be given a password, automatically 
      generated by the system. Data providers must use their passwords to gain 
      access to their records. Use of a password ensures that unauthorized 
      persons will not be able to alter information about properties. At any 
      time, data providers should be able to return to the web site to modify or 
      update the information they have submitted. Data providers should be 
      required to return to the site on a routine basis, such as, at least once 
      every six months to keep records current. The status of a record could be 
      listed as "Active," "Inactive," or "Sold." Active sites could be those 
      sites that currently are for sale. Inactive sites could be sites that have 
      been or may become available for sale, but currently are not for sale. 
      Sold sites could be sites that have been sold and are no longer available 
      to purchase. Data providers should be free to change the status at any 
      time.</FONT></P>

      ADMINISTRATION</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A web site should include a 
      web page that can be used for administration purposes and not accessible 
      to the public. It should be accessible only to approved administrators who 
      need instant access to information about the performance of the web site. 
      Access to the administrative page can be controlled through a login 
      screen.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use of a web site should be

      MAINTENANCE</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Web sites that include 
      information about brownfields properties should be designed in a manner 
      that will minimize the time required for data management and site 
      maintenance. A routine schedule of data management tasks is necessary to 
      insure that the database remains current. Outdated records must be 
      deleted, and new sites must be added to the database. Insofar as possible, 
      the data management process should be automated. Outdated records should 
      expire automatically after a reasonable time period, such as three months. 
      Each quarter, automatic e-mail notifications should be used to warn data 
      providers that their records are about to expire. After receiving e-mail 
      notification, the data provider should be required to return to the web 
      site to delete outdated records and to renew records that should remain 
      active.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although automation will 
      reduce the time required for data maintenance, database specialists may be 
      required to validate new records and to perform certain data conversion or 
      manipulation tasks. The database is not likely to grow quickly if users 
      are required to enter all new records one at a time, using the web page 
      data entry form. Therefore, if the user has more than 20 new sites to add 
      to the database, the user should have the option of providing data to the 
      system operator in an MS Access data structure that can be downloaded from 
      the brownfields property web site. The user can update the MS Access 
      database by manually entering records on predesigned forms. As an 
      alternative, the user could update the database using standard functions 
      of MS Access. The updated MS Access database could be sent to the system 
      operator through e-mail or FTP. Database specialists for the system 
      operator could import the new data into an Oracle database. If the user 
      has more than 100 new sites to add to the database, the user can provide 
      the system operator with a data dump in any digital format, including MS 
      Access, MS Excel, Oracle, or delimited text files. Database specialists 
      could then convert the data into a usable format and import the data into 
      the database.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A name=table2></A>Table 2 
      presents a sample data update cycle. The data maintenance cycle is the 
      time elapsed from the date on which the brownfields property web site 
      receives the data and the date on which the data become "Active" in the 
      database. Only "active" records should be visible to users.</FONT></P>
