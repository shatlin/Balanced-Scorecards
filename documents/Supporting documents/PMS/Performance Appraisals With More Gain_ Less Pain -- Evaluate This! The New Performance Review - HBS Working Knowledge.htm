<DIV class=blurb2>For many managers, writing performance appraisals is akin to 
root canal—only more painful. It shouldn't be. Here are tips for improving your

<P>Short of firing, what is the responsibility managers hate the most? If you're 
thinking "performance appraisal," then you may have something to learn from 
<EM>The Performance Appraisal Question and Answer Book: A Survival Guide for 
Managers</EM>, by Dick Grote, a former manager at General Electric and PepsiCo 
who has become one of the country's leading experts on the topic. While this 
practical handbook may not make you look forward to your next set of year-end 
meetings, it can certainly help you manage the process far more effectively—and 
spare you that "I'd really rather be having a root canal" feeling as well.</P>
<P>Performance appraisals, if done correctly, says Grote, can become the most 
valuable instrument in the manager's toolbox. "No other management process," he 
says, "has as much influence over individuals' careers and work lives." Let's 
consider the benefits. On the most practical level, the few hours a manager 
invests in a careful appraisal process can help improve an employee's 
performance for an entire year. More broadly, an effective evaluation process is 
part of the strategic first-rate people management that helps top companies 
succeed. In fact, many of the companies judged the best at performance 
evaluation in a 1999 survey conducted by the Houston-based American Productivity 
&amp; Quality Center and the Lexington, Mass.-based Linkage Inc. refused to 
divulge their evaluation techniques, viewing them as key components of their 
competitive strategies. "We would no more show our performance appraisal form to 
a bunch of outsiders," said one participating VP of human resources, "than the 
Coca-Cola Company would let you come in and look over the secret formula for 
Coke."</P>
<P><SPAN class=article-subtitles>The calendar, not the clock</SPAN><BR>A 
successful performance appraisal process rests on a few key fundamentals: 
timing, clarity, and consistency. </P>
<P>Timing first. Performance appraisals should be governed by the calendar, not 
the clock. Managers should hold at least two formal meetings with each employee 
every year—one at the beginning, to plan, and one at the end, to review. And in 
between, managers should be coaching their employees every day.</P>
<P>They should also keep a regular written log of employees' performance. Why a 
log? Because managers, being human, have imperfect memories. Many people in 
supervisory roles don't prepare for evaluations until the very end of the year 
that the reviews are supposed to evaluate. Between recency bias and the 
all-too-human tendency to focus on the negative, however, a December 
retrospective is likely to lose track of many examples of positive performance 
from the previous eleven months. ("There are no such things," warns Grote, "as 
mental notes.") Lesson: Start early.</P>

    <TD align=right><SPAN class=pull-quote-small>—Dick Grote</SPAN> 
  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Clear understanding of the position in question comes next: You can't 
evaluate how well an employee has done a job until both of you are clear about 
exactly what the job is. Every position, says Grote, has five or six key 
responsibilities. If you didn't clearly articulate them earlier in the year, you 
need to sit down and figure them out before you start evaluating how well the 
employee has handled them.</P>
<P>Item three is consistency. A truly effective review process, Grote reminds 
his readers, is one that ties directly into the company's mission statement and 
values. This principle may seem head-thumpingly obvious, but in practice it's as 
rare as a consultant without a cell phone. Case in point: An informal survey 
Grote conducted several years ago, when speaking before a group of human 
resources executives from many of the companies in the Fortune 1000:</P>
<P><EM>"How many of you," he asked, "can take your performance appraisal form in 
your left hand and your mission statement in your right hand, and walk up to one 
of your employees and say, 'Harry, look! Do you see where the words in the 
performance appraisal and the words in the mission statement are the same 
words?' If you can, raise your hand."</EM></P>
<P>Of the 600 right hands in the room, only about nineteen went up. Would 
yours?</P>
<P><SPAN class=article-subtitles>Brass tacks</SPAN><BR>Grote's pragmatic Q&amp;A 
format focuses on the practical details as much as it does on general 
principles. How, for instance, can your company phrase the questions in its 
appraisal form so that managers can evaluate their staff accurately without 
raising hackles? One suggestion: Solicit facts, not opinions. Don't ask, "How 
good was this employee's performance?" Instead, ask, "What proportion of the 
time did the employee perform this task at a truly professional level?" The more 
objective the questions, the more useful and persuasive the answers will be.</P>
<P>Another practical insight: Evaluation inflation, and employees' expectations 
of inflated ratings, can be avoided by pegging the score range in the right 
place. According to the laws of mathematics, most people do an average job. 
According to the laws of human nature, however, most people hate to be rated as 
average.</P>
<P>If you have a five-point evaluation scale, then, don't characterize the 
middle rating as "acceptable" or "fair." Instead, treat it as a "par" score in 
golf. Par, Grote reminds us, "doesn't mean average or mediocre…. A pro golfer 
can often do better, but par is what is expected of an expert." If reaching the 
middle score is an accomplishment people can be proud of, a company can reset 
inflated expectations and get a valid read on performance as well.</P>

<P>Grote also recommends that senior HR managers who supervise the company's 
evaluation process train managers to fill out evaluation forms correctly and 
calibrate scores for consistency across the organization.</P>
<P><EM>The Performance Appraisal Question and Answer Book</EM> also offers 
advice on how to handle the dreaded review meeting. Some suggestions are simple 
tips that too many managers fail to follow. Be brave enough to tell the truth, 
and rest your case on specific examples when you do. Avoid surprises. And if you 
want to be heard, don't just talk—listen, too.</P>
<P>One last practical tip: As you prepare for the review meeting, focus. People 
rarely hear everything you say, particularly when they are ill at ease or under 
stress. So if you want the employee to hear a core message, make it clear to 
yourself first. Grote says:</P>
<P><EM>Imagine that a few weeks ago you had your annual performance appraisal 
discussion with Joanne. This morning, as you're walking down the hall,…you pull 
her aside and say, 'Joanne, a few weeks ago we had a performance appraisal 
discussion. Tell me something…what do you remember from that discussion?' What 
is that one thing that you want to have stuck in her memory? Whatever it is, 
that is your core message.</EM></P>
<P><SPAN class=article-subtitles>Set goals and achieve 
them</SPAN><BR>Performance appraisal is a tool to facilitate good management—a 
means to an end, not an end in itself. With this idea in mind, Grote bases the 
performance appraisal process on the principle (set forth long ago by Peter 
Drucker) that the best managers help their people do two main things: Set goals 
and achieve them.</P>
<P>Douglas McGregor expounded upon this theory in the <EM>Harvard Business 
Review</EM> back in 1957. Developing people effectively, he argued in the 
language of the era,</P>
<P><EM>…does not include coercing them (no matter how benevolently) into 
acceptance of the goals of the enterprise, nor does it mean manipulating their 
behavior to suit organizational needs. Rather, it calls for creating a 
relationship within which a man can take responsibility for developing his own 
potentialities, plan for himself, and learn from putting his plan into 
action.</EM></P>
<P>This theory underlies the success that performance appraisal is designed to 
measure.</P>
<P>Soon after Drucker and McGregor articulated the principle of management by 
objectives, General Electric studied its implications. "Criticism," GE found, 
"has a negative effect on achievement of goals; praise has little effect one way 
or the other." GE also determined that the best way to improve performance is to 
have manager and employee sit down together and establish specific goals that 
are based on the individual's strengths. This approach beats relying only on 
such secondary stimuli as good salaries, generous benefits packages, job 
security, or prestige. Why? Because real job satisfaction, commitment, and a 
sense of achievement come ultimately from the job itself.</P>
<P>Eliciting peak performance begins with designing satisfying jobs but doesn't 
end there. You have to find the best people to fill these positions; plan 
employees' daily, monthly, and yearly tasks; create conditions that motivate; 
and deal with problems as they come up. Evaluating the work that has been done, 
though an important step, comes only at the end of the process. Managers who do 
all of these steps right will find that performance appraisal is no longer an 
ordeal they dread, but rather a valuable tool that helps them do their own jobs 
better—namely, helping their employees do the best job they can.<IMG alt=""
