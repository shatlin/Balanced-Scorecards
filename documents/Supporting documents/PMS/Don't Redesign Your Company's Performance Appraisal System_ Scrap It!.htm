    <TD bgColor=#ffffff><FONT face=Arial size=2>This article appeared in the 
      May-June 1997 issue of <I>Corporate University Review</I>.</FONT>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Abstract</FONT></H3>
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial size=2>At a time when many corporations are engaged 
      in unrelenting searches for ways to improve operations and reduce costs, 
      there is one aspect of organizational life that has largely escaped 
      scrutiny: Performance Appraisal. Perhaps this is because performance 
      appraisals have become an unquestioned fact of life in most large 
      organizations. As with most unquestioned facts, a critical examination can 
      prove beneficial.</FONT> </I></P>
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial size=2>In this article, the author points out that 
      the hard costs of operating formal performance appraisal systems are 
      measured in billions of dollars annually and that the soft costs might be 
      even higher. The primary offsets to these costs are the purported benefits 
      of performance appraisal systems. Upon inspection, these appear to range 
      from non-existent to minimal.</FONT> </I></P>
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial size=2>Here, then, is a situation rife with 
      opportunity for organizations willing to challenge the status 
      quo.</FONT></I></P>
      <H2><FONT face=Arial size=2>Introduction</FONT></H2>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you’re a change-minded senior executive 
      looking for ways to improve performance, cut costs, or free up resources 
      that can be redirected against important issues waiting in the wings, you 
      might give serious thought to scrapping your company’s performance 
      appraisal system. It devours staggering amounts of time and energy, it 
      depresses and demotivates people, it destroys trust and teamwork and, 
      adding insult to injury, it delivers little demonstrable value at great 
      cost.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Here’s a quick and easy performance appraisal 
      cost-estimating exercise you can apply to your own company: double the 
      number of employees who receive appraisals, add three zeroes, and place a 
      dollar sign in front of the resultant number. That’s the cost of the 
      performance appraisal system at your company. If you think $2,000 per 
      employee is too high, don’t double the number of employees, just add three 
      zeroes. [ Lest you think this estimating methodology too cavalier, please 
      know that two very thorough cost estimates were submitted by respondents 
      to the e-mail survey that gave rise to this paper. One came in at $1,945 
      per employee and the other at $2,200. The latter included the costs of 
      union participation so it was rounded down to $2,000.] But you probably 
      won’t like that result either.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you do scrap your company’s performance 
      appraisal system you will accomplish more than realize a sizable cost 
      savings; you will also, in one bold move, unfreeze your organization’s 
      culture <I>and</I> eliminate one of the chief structural obstacles to any 
      changes you and your management team might be contemplating.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The one thing you should<B><I> not</I></B> do 
      is listen to those who will implore you to let them redesign the 
      performance appraisal system to make it more supportive of the changes you 
      have in mind.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Some reading these words will consider the 
      previous comments outrageous and unfounded. But, as Craig Brooks, the 
      director of a Winona, Minnesota human services organization and a 26-year 
      veteran of performance appraisal sessions claims, "I could retire on the 
      salary I earned during those meetings." An exaggeration? Perhaps, but the 
      point is clear enough: performance appraisals chew up a lot of time and 
      money. On the other hand, they supposedly provide benefits that offset 
      these costs. But do they? The Internet offered an unprecedented means of 
      finding out and so, during the last two months of 1995, three e-mail 
      messages were posted in quick succession to several discussion lists on 
      the Internet (see the list at the end of this paper). The first message 
      dealt with the form and function of the "classic" performance appraisal 
      system — one where a manager appraises the performance of a subordinate or 
      "direct report." The second proposed an informal cost-benefit analysis of 
      such appraisal systems. It included a starter list of costs and benefits 
      as well as a call for additional costs and benefits from anyone interested 
      in participating. The third presented a summary and synthesis of all 
      responses and some rather obvious conclusions. The bottom line? 
      Performance appraisal systems provide questionable benefits at amazingly 
      high costs. In one company alone, the costs were conservatively estimated 
      at almost $100 million.</FONT></P>

      <H2><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Accepted Mythology of Performance 
      Appraisal Systems</FONT></H2>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>From the viewpoint of senior executives, 
      performance appraisal systems are generally regarded as a necessary part 
      of the organization’s management system. This condition seems to exist 
      because of the widely accepted, generally unquestioned benefits of 
      performance appraisal systems. If asked, a typical executive might 
      indicate the following benefits:</FONT> 
      <OL style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The system provides employees with an 
        opportunity to receive feedback regarding their performance, usually at 
        least once a year and often on an interim basis during the year. This 
        leads to reduced error and waste, increased productivity, improved 
        quality and service for customers, as well as enhanced employee 
        motivation, commitment, and a sense of ownership.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The system provides an opportunity for 
        performance related discussions that include the following aims: setting 
        work objectives for the employee, aligning individual and organizational 
        goals, identifying training and development needs, and discussing career 
        progression opportunities.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The system standardizes performance 
        appraisals and makes them objective by providing uniform processes and 
        criteria. This further results in a fair, valid, and legally defensible 
        basis for rewarding and recognizing individual performance.</FONT> 
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The system affords the corporation legal 
        protection against employee lawsuits for discrimination and wrongful 
        termination.</FONT> </LI></OL>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A perhaps less typical but more candid 
      executive might add a final benefit: the formal performance appraisal 
      system shores up an organization’s hierarchical authority system. It gives 
      the supervising manager control over the carrots and sticks in what is 
      essentially a carrot-and-stick management system.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The list of benefits above, with the exception 
      of the last one, represents an idealized view of performance appraisal 
      systems, a view that is espoused by many but achieved by few, if any. Why? 
      What is it about organizations that causes performance appraisal systems 
      to fall short of this ideal? Can we or should we try to change things so 
      that performance appraisal systems work the way we want? Or is there a 
      better course of action? Answering these questions requires taking a 
      rational look at the form and function of performance appraisal systems, 
      and the effects such systems have on the very people they are intended to 
      help.</FONT></P>

      <H4 align=center><EM><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>Figure 1 - A Basic 
      Performance Appraisal System</FONT></B> </EM></H4>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The general form of a basic performance 
      appraisal system is depicted in Figure 1. A discussion follows.</FONT> 
</P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Based on his or her perceptions, a manager 
      prepares an appraisal of another employee. Appraisals typically have two 
      components: text, and a number. The number is usually the basis for 
      determining the employee’s merit increase (i.e., the size of the pay raise 
      for the subsequent year). This is often quite modest and amounts to little 
      more than a cost-of-living increase, an offset against inflation. 
      Moreover, differences between the maximum and minimum increases are also 
      quite modest. The merit carrot is not a very big one.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Perhaps the most significant aspect of the 
      structure depicted in Figure 1 is that the appraisal has as its primary 
      input the perceptions of the manager. Technically speaking, they are the 
      only input. Given this model, it is obvious that if the system is to work 
      effectively the manager’s perceptions must be objective, accurate, 
      comprehensive, and free from any significant bias, distortion or undue 
      influence; otherwise, the system is patently flawed. This leads to the 
      following assertion:</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The structure of the typical performance 
      appraisal system makes managers who prepare appraisals the targets of 
      efforts aimed at influencing, shaping, and just plain manipulating their 
      perceptions and the appraisals based on these perceptions.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Several people have an interest in influencing 
      a manager’s appraisal of a given employee’s performance. The most obvious 
      is the employee. But there are others. These include other employees who 
      are being appraised by the same manager, and anyone with a vested interest 
      in having a given employee receive a good or a bad appraisal; for example, 
      clients, customers, mentors, co-workers, and other managers whose own 
      subordinates must compete for a finite pool of merit increase monies, plum 
      assignments, and increasingly limited promotion opportunities. In a word, 
      the politics of performance appraisal can be fierce. The preceding 
      assertion may be elaborated upon as follows:</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Many efforts to influence the perceptions of 
      the managers who prepare appraisals, and the appraisals they prepare, are 
      independent of and often have no relation to the performance of the person 
      being appraised.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>People and politics are not the only forces 
      tending to negate the positive potential of performance appraisal systems. 
      There are also important systemic or structural factors at work.</FONT> 
      </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>An appraisal leads to a merit increase. The 
      size of the merit pool is limited and the distribution of these monies is 
      typically according to some formula. Thus, in a performance appraisal 
      system that allocates merit increase percentage on a five-point scale, not 
      everyone can receive a five because there isn’t enough money available to 
      support such an outcome. This is a restraint, a "can’t do." By the same 
      token, the numbers assigned must fit within the limits of the available 
      pool of merit monies. This is a constraint, a "must do." Restraints and 
      constraints can also include EEO and affirmative action considerations. 
      Because merit rating numbers must be adjusted to meet various restraints 
      and constraints, the language and tone of the appraisals must in turn be 
      adjusted so as to be consistent with the numbers. From this follows an 
      inescapable conclusion: the honest, fair, valid, and objective assessment 
      of all employees is literally impossible. The structure, restraints, and 
      constraints of the system do not permit it.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The preceding discussion looks at performance 
      appraisal systems mainly from a managerial perspective. But how does it 
      look to employees, and what are its effects on them? People responding to 
      the Internet queries provided the following answers to these 
      questions.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Reductions in Productivity</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Several people cited temporary reductions in 
      productivity in the aftermath of the appraisal review sessions. One person 
      estimated this period of reduced contribution lasts for about three 
      months. An employee of the federal government said this period lasts at 
      least six months. Even if it is assumed that such periods last no more 
      than a few days or weeks, and that they represent a decrease in 
      productivity of no more than 10 percent, the costs are still 
      astronomical.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Erosion of Performance</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Tauo Jokinen, a product development manager 
      with Nokia, conjectured that performance appraisal systems actually erode 
      performance over time as a result of people endeavoring to set goals that 
      are achievable, thus ensuring themselves a decent appraisal. This might be 
      viewed as a form of structural <I>deflation</I> regarding performance, and 
      it is quite reminiscent of the late Kenneth Berrien’s view that management 
      might control the lower limits of productivity but employees are clearly 
      in control of the upper limits. [ Berrien’s comments were made in the 
      context of a discussion about the balance of control between a supra 
      system and its subsystems, and can be found in Chapter VII of <I>General 
      and Social Systems</I> (Rutgers University Press: 1968).]</FONT> </P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Creation of Emotional Anguish</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Also cited were negative emotional states: 
      worrying, depression, stress, and anguish (on the part of those giving as 
      well as those receiving appraisals). After first acknowledging the "hard" 
      costs of performance appraisals, Harry Heflin, an engineer with Intersys 
      who is also chairman of the IEEE Engineering Management Society in Boston, 
      wrote, "But I think the real cost is the emotional anguish as everyone 
      anticipates, prepares for, and works the process."</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Damaging to Morale &amp; 
Motivation</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Closely related to the emotional factors cited 
      above are the penalties paid in the form of decreased morale and 
      motivation. These are deemed especially severe when the performance 
      appraisal system is seen as "bad" or unfair. An element of unfairness 
      cited by Charles Ladd, a TQM consultant, is the use of performance 
      appraisal systems to reward or punish people for what are really natural 
      variations in system or process performance. This means that people are 
      praised and rewarded or cursed and punished for factors beyond their power 
      to influence let alone control.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Emphasizing Individual vs. Team and Task vs. 
      Process</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>One factor the author was sure would be cited, 
      but wasn’t, is that the classic performance appraisal system emphasizes 
      individual or task-level performance instead of team or process 
      performance. Appraising individual performance can be a divisive factor in 
      an environment where genuine teamwork is required. Consequently, in times 
      of change, retaining an appraisal system that focuses on individual task 
      performance sends at best a mixed message when management calls for teams 
      or wants to focus on business process performance instead of individual 
      task performance.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Fostering A Short-term View</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Another factor the author thought would be 
      cited and wasn’t is the short-term view that is inherent in annual 
      performance appraisal systems. Essentially, annual performance appraisal 
      systems ask of employees, "What have you done for us <I>this</I> year?" 
      Employee contributions over time — past or future — do not enter into the 
      equation. Little wonder, then, that Mike Hammer, the famed reengineering 
      guru, could be heard lamenting the lack of a long-term view in one of his 
      recent seminars. [ Mike could be heard uttering this lament in Boston, on 
      December 4, 1995, during the first offering of his new seminar, "The 
      Process-Centered Organization." Mike was lambasting the media and the 
      educational establishment for churning out young people with a short-term, 
      self-interested view.]</FONT> </P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Institutionalizing Existing Values &amp; 
      Biases</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A military officer with a Ph.D., who is 
      stationed at the Pentagon and who wishes to remain anonymous, observed 
      that performance appraisal systems serve to institutionalize the values 
      and prejudices of those in power — and to protect these values and 
      prejudices from challenge. Consultant Charles Ladd made this same 
      observation independently of the officer. Both argued that this aspect of 
      performance appraisal systems forms a structural impediment to cultural 
      change, that it acts to maintain the status quo.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Fostering Fear and Lack of Trust</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Directly related to the factors cited above is 
      the degree of fear associated with the appraisal system. This ties to a 
      lack of trust in one’s boss, and management in general, and leads to a 
      phenomenon known as "malicious compliance," that is, a passive-aggressive 
      stance of "tell me what you want me to do and I’ll do it" on the part of 
      an employee. As one might expect, Deming’s dictum to drive fear out of the 
      workplace was frequently cited in this context.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>A Carrot-and-Stick Management 
      System</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The source of the fear cited above owes to the 
      fact that the carrot-and-stick nature of appraisal systems is mostly 
      stick. Performance appraisals become a permanent part of the employees’ 
      personnel folders. There, many people have access to them including 
      prospective employers elsewhere within the company, the human resources 
      department (HR), and other executives and senior managers. Past appraisals 
      exert a significant influence over status and standing, future 
      assignments, and promotions. Thus, although performance appraisal systems 
      do not distribute much in the way of rewards, they can inflict great 
      damage. Control of appraisals is largely in the hands of the employee’s 
      supervisor. Savvy employees know that success hinges in large part on 
      "psyching out the boss." They also know that when senior executives call 
      for change, the marching orders, if any, will come from their 
      supervisors.</FONT></P>
      <H3><FONT face=Arial size=2>Redesigning Performance Appraisal Systems Is A 
      Sisyphean Task</FONT></H3>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In short, for political, structural, and 
      systemic reasons, performance appraisal systems cannot function as 
      intended. Worse, they seem to have an almost exclusively negative impact 
      on the very employees they are meant to help. This view of performance 
      appraisals squarely contradicts the mythology of performance appraisal 
      systems. Further, the reasons performance appraisal systems fail to 
      provide the benefits claimed for them seem firmly rooted in the nature of 
      organizations and the behavior of people. Trying to change these factors 
      so that performance appraisal systems will work the way they are intended 
      is truly a modern-day version of Sisyphus’s legendary task.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>All things considered, one would hope that 
      performance appraisal systems are relatively inexpensive. This is not the 
      case.</FONT></P>

      <H1 align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Costs</FONT></H1>
      <HR align=center>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The costs cited by the Internet respondents run 
      the gamut from obviously quantifiable or hard costs to soft costs or costs 
      that are much more difficult to quantify. The preceding discussion can be 
      viewed in large measure as a discussion of the soft costs. The following 
      discussion focuses on the hard costs. These consist chiefly of the direct 
      and indirect expenses associated with the following activities:</FONT>

        written at lower levels</FONT>

        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>handling post-appraisal appeals, grievances, 
        and lawsuits</FONT> </LI></UL>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A manager who works as a reengineering 
      specialist for a large overseas retailing operation used only the first 
      three cost categories above to derive an annual per-employee cost of 
      $1,945. He then reduced his company’s 130,000 employee count to 85,000 
      full-time equivalents (FTEs). He further assumed that only 60 percent of 
      those FTEs actually receive a performance appraisal. Even so, his 
      calculations place the cost of his company’s performance appraisals at a 
      staggering $100 million. As he pointed out, these are not out-of-pocket 
      costs, but they do represent the cost of the time used.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Johann Hanekom, CEO of a 500-person subsidiary 
      of a South African telecommunications company, indicated that the labor 
      costs required to recover all operating expenses and burden at his company 
      are pegged at $85 per hour. Using his estimate of hours, the annual 
      per-person cost of performance appraisals at his company comes to $2,200. 
      This amounts to a company-wide cost of $1.1 million per year. (Hanekom’s 
      estimate includes the cost of union participation.)</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hanekom also suggested that the linkage between 
      merit increases and the performance appraisal system contributes to a form 
      of structural inflation. Whether through union bargaining or the 
      uncoordinated demands of people for decent ratings, wages and salaries 
      increase more than would be the case if there were no performance 
      appraisal system or if it were not linked to the annual pay increase. In 
      short, performance appraisal systems provide financial leverage to 
      employees and unions as well as to management.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A reasonable person would be hard pressed to 
      argue that the benefits of performance appraisal systems outweigh their 
      costs. The costs are extraordinary and many of the supposed benefits cited 
      do not withstand serious scrutiny. Of what benefit or credibility, for 
      instance, are career discussions in organizations where downsizing and 
      layoffs are the order of the day?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Performance-related discussions between bosses 
      and subordinates do not require a formal, full-blown performance appraisal 
      system. Indeed, it can be argued that the real coaching and counseling 
      sessions that shape and improve employee performance occur informally, 
      outside such systems. The same can be said of goal setting and feedback. 
      It is also questionable if much of what passes for feedback in formal 
      performance appraisal sessions is deserving of the term. [ For a quick 
      look at how the concept of feedback in the social sciences differs 
      markedly from its technical origins, see my article, "Feedback About 
      Feedback," in the Human Resources Development Quarterly (Jossey-Bass: Fall 
      1995). For a scholarly and well-researched examination of the evolution of 
      feedback thought, see George P. Richardson’s marvelous book, Feedback 
      Thought in Social Science and Systems Theory (University of Pennsylvania 
      Press: 1991).] If feedback is viewed as information about actual 
      conditions compared against a set of reference conditions, and if the 
      results are measurable and measured, what role does the manager 
      <I>really</I> play? If they are neither measurable nor measured, what role 
      <I>can</I> the manager play?</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The need for a basis on which to allocate the 
      annual merit increase presupposes the need for an annual merit increase. 
      If this is indeed the case, the reasons for it need to be examined. If it 
      serves as a cost-of-living increase, a hedge against inflation, this can 
      be done on a flat-rate basis without the need for a performance appraisal 
      system.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If pay increases are warranted for other 
      reasons, it is unlikely that they require a performance appraisal system 
      to administer. Bonuses or other special increases can and should be tied 
      to very specific, very visible, very measurable results, and this doesn’t 
      require a performance appraisal system. Profit sharing is another case in 
      point.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Poor performers probably constitute less than 
      10 percent of the work force, so why incur the expense of keeping book on 
      the entire work force? Moreover, keeping book on poor performers does not 
      require an elaborate, formal performance appraisal system. Worse, the 
      books kept on those who are not poor performers can backfire in court. As 
      Craig Brooks wrote, "The typical, traditional performance appraisal is 
      worthless and, in fact, lawyers have told me the appraisal itself quite 
      often is management’s worst enemy in disciplinary grievances and court 
      challenges." Brooks is not alone. Several people pointed out that 
      performance appraisal systems might increase, not decrease the costs of 
      appeals, grievances, and lawsuits. The legal protection provided by 
      performance appraisal systems seems questionable.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Perhaps the greatest cost of all is that 
      performance appraisal systems silently mock senior executives who call for 
      change. This is embarrassingly apparent when initiative after initiative 
      pleads to have the performance appraisal system changed to support its 
      aims. Such pleas offer compelling testimony that performance appraisal 
      systems are seen as a basic device for getting individuals to comply with 
      the aims of management. This emphasis on compliance is the status quo that 
      such systems maintain, no matter how much they are redesigned. This 
      emphasis is out of place in a world where the ability to elicit 
      contributions from employees matters more than the ability to ensure 
      compliance. As a purely practical matter, given the time lag between 
      changes in the aims of management and changes to performance appraisal 
      systems to support those new aims, it seems unlikely that changes to 
      performance appraisal systems can keep pace.</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In conclusion, performance appraisal systems 
      could be eliminated with no harm done and with great economic and 
      emotional benefit. Consequently, change-minded executives should not 
      listen to pleas to redesign their company’s performance appraisal system 
      but should instead give serious thought to scrapping it.</FONT></P>
