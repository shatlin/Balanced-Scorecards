<P>In <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_1/">part 
one</A> of this Simple Steps series I talked about how to use a simple ratio, 
that of the paper size you are using, to create a symmetrical grid on which to 
create your designs. This, the second part in the series, will deal with other 
ratios and how they can be combined to create more complex grid systems.</P>
<H2>Relating to grid systems</H2>
<P>I've talked a <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/articles/detail/design_and_the_divine_proportion/">few 
times</A> about using the Golden, or 'Divine', Section in the grid systems you 
design. So, before you continue I suggest you read the background in <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/articles/detail/design_and_the_divine_proportion/">this 
article</A> and my article in <A href="http://www.designinflight.com/">Design in 
Flight</A>. For those who don't want fork out your hard earned cash on the DiF 
article, I'll summarise:</P>
<P>The Golden Section is a ratio which is evident throughout the universe as the 
number Phi. You can use this ratio to good effect in design by making sure that 
elements of your grid conform to this ratio. Using the Golden Section can ensure 
a natural sense of correct composition, even though it is based in mathematics 
it will 'feel' right.</P>
<P>This is an important point and has been argued and debated for ages. 
Aesthetics can be measured and more importantly can be constructed. If you want 
something to be aesthetically pleasing there are steps you can take to make sure 
it is going in the right direction. Now I'm not saying that 'follow these rules 
and you will create something beautiful'. What I am saying is that by following 
a few of these guidelines can go some way into creating something 
compositionally balanced, which will inherently be more aesthetically 
pleasing.</P>
<H3>Composition can make things more usable</H3>
<P>This is a theory that exists called the 'Aesthetic Usability Effect'. I have 
<A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/aesthetic_usability_effect/">written 
about this as well in the past</A>, I find it a really interesting theory. This 
theory suggests that things which are designed to be beautiful are inherently 
more usable as a result. It is an interesting theory and can certainly challenge 
the usability field, which is often tarnished with the 'ugly brush'. </P>
<P>Composing grids using theory and balanced ratios (such as the Golden 
Section), which in turn enable the creation of beautiful, balanced designs. 
These designs then have a quality which will make them more usable, according to 
the theory. Perhaps I'm labouring the point here, but in short: </P>
<P><STRONG>Well designed grid systems can make your designs not only more 
beautiful and legible, but more <EM>usable.</EM></STRONG></P>
<H3>Putting it into practice</H3>
<P>As in the first article I'm going to be desiging this grid in context. For 
those of you who are primarily web based I'm afraid this is going to be another 
print example, but that doesn't mean this theory can't applied to web. It can of 
course be applied to lots of different medium, from architecture and interior 
design to product design and art, you just have to apply it to a different 
'canvas'.</P>
<P>So, as in the DiF article the brief is to design a book. Unlike the first 
article in this series, I'm going to be applying the grid to a double page 
spread rather than a single page, this is called an <EM>asymmetrical grid</EM> 
as opposed to the symmetrical grid I designed in the last article.</P>
<H3>Shaping the page</H3>
<P>For this grid, we're going to use the ratio of the page to define the main 
text, or content, area of the pages. There's a very simple way of reducing this 
page size down to make sure the ratio is correctly placed and balanced. See 
diagram.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=247 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 2  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grid_pt2_1.gif" 
width=480></P>
<P>We now have an area, shown in red, in which to construct the grid.</P>
<H3>Applying the Golden Section</H3>
<P>Now you've read the other articles you will see that applying the ratio to 
this area is pretty straight forward. The area is divided using Phi which gives 
us two columns, A and B.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=247 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 2  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grid_pt2_2.gif" 
width=480></P>
<H3>Creating the system</H3>
<P>So, we've got the columns, we now need to flesh out the grid to be able to 
cope with the different content and page types. First off, we extend the lines 
of the content area and the columns.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=247 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 2  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grid_pt2_3.gif" 
width=480></P>
<P>We then apply a horizontal rule cutting across content area creation lines. I 
call these 'hanging lines', not too sure what the correct terminology is. But 
anyway, the content 'hangs' from these lines giving us consistency throughout 
the book. It gives the reader a line, in the same place, to rest their eyes on 
page after page.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=247 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 2  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grid_pt2_4.gif" 
width=480></P>
<P>Using the extended lines we can then add areas for the access structure of 
the book—folios etc. These typically sit outside of the content area, usually 
with plenty of white space around them, as to show that they are different 
'types' of content.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=247 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 2  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grid_pt2_5.gif" 
width=480></P>
<P>We can then add various designs to this grid comfortable in knowing that the 
individual elements of the design—text, images, access structure elements—will 
all have a relationship to each other and to the book size.</P>
<H3>Relating to grid systems</H3>
<P>Creating grid systems in this way—using ratios to create <EM>related</EM> 
lines on which to construct composition—ensures a balanced grid.</P>
<P>I'm afraid it isn't an exact science though. A lot of grid design is 
experimentation with ratios, it's experimentation with using white space and 
elements of content such as photographs and text. It's also about conventions. 
Don't reinvent the wheel needlessly, study the conventions used in magazines 
from all sectors—from architecture to nursing (seriously, some magazines from 
unexpected professional sectors have fantastic grid designs).</P>
<P>What I'm saying is, have a play with grid design. Just because I'm talking 
about ratios, subdivisions and modularisation, doesn't mean designing grids 
should be dull. Have a mind on the end product, but not at the expense of the 
<EM>process</EM> of designing your grid.</P>
<H3>The series</H3>
<P>This is the second installment of this "Simple Steps..." series.</P>

<P>In diagram (2), are A and B divinely proportional because the splice line 
falls in the middle of each page or are the dimensions of the pages such that 
the split of the page just happens to fall near the middle of the page? </P>

articles.&nbsp; I’m using these steps when laying out a newsletter I’ll be 
updating later this month.&nbsp; So this series is perfect timing. </P>
<P>Hey, have you given thought about taking over Design-In-Flight, since Andy

<P>First off, just want to say that I really dig your current series on grid 
design and your past posts on the topic. </P>
<P>My question is how can we apply the grid design theory on page whose length 
is determined by data and is not fixed? </P>
<P>Do you arbitrarily set a height and based the design on that? </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Sean</STRONG> - thanks for your comments! </P>
<P>I presume you’re talking about website design or some kind of online/screen 
based application? </P>
<P>Well, I am going to be discussing this in one of the parts of this series, 
but in the mean time… </P>
<P>I’ve been looking into this in some detail. Most grid system theory is based 
on fixed ‘canvas’ sizes - eg page sizes etc. But that doesn’t mean grids can be 
adapted depending on size. It really is a challange when a grid system has to 
adapt to not only a different canvas, or screen size, but also has to adapt to 
different type sizes. That is without getting into the whole fixed/fluid debate 
at the moment. </P>
<P>I’m trying to get my head around all the different aspects at the moment to 
make sure I can distill it all down to a small article. I’m not sure that’s 
going to possible. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>I remember my favorite thing from Geometry class in high school was learning 
about the golden ratio and how it could be used to make perfect rectangles. In a 
perfect rectangle, the long side is always 1.6? longer than the short side. 
These dimensions are used everywhere; in flags, crosses, and logos. Now I 
finally know why 1.6 was that magic number. I’ve always been interested in 
learning to use the golden ratio in my designs, and now I finally know how. 
Thanks, Mark. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Scottish, it’s something of an old wive’s tale that gutters have to be 
especially large for perfect binding. Book pages are nearly always more 
attractive when the outside margin is set larger than the inside margin, and an 
inside margin as small as 3p is still legible. </P>
<P>An excellent book on grids (for both print <EM>and</EM> web is “Grid Systems” 
by Kimberly Elam (Princeton Architectural press). In addition to showing the 
basics, it works through case stuies of sites and books, posters, etc. to show 
actual grids in action. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Scottish</STRONG> - Mandy is right. Smallish gutters work find with 
perfect binding, although it is somethign you have to be mindful of. Having a 
larger outside margin is a practical consideration, especially for books, 
because the reader has to have somewhere for their thumb! </P>

<P>Mark - I think what you just mentioned are two of the fundamental reasons why 
the web is so different from any other media.&nbsp; The fact that your canvas 
does grow and is somewhat fluid throws a wrench in it all. </P>
<P>I am anxiously awaiting to see how you will tackle this particular problem.

<P><STRONG>Sean</STRONG> - Me too! No, seriously, the reason why I’m using 
ratios in these first two articles is an indication on where I think grids for 
web can go, that and repetition of grid elements. As long as the 
<EM>proportions</EM> remain, then it goes some way to answer the problem for the 
grid systems on the web. </P>
<P>The potential problems arise when you try and have a proportional grid, which 
is fluid, that has a clear and direct relationship with the typography. So, as 
the typography changes size (cos the user changes it), then the grid must adapt 
and change to make sure the grid/typography link is still retained. </P>
<P>A bit fiddly, but by no means impossible. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Mad? Oh, aye, absolutely . . . but sometimes love involves (ahem) 
interaction, no? </P>
<P>It will be interesting to apply your ratios to specific web-page sizes. 
Granted, browser windows are maddeningly changeable, but I often wonder if 
static forms--if they’re the right ones--might sometimes give the reader/viewer 
a more pleasant experience. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Regarding the application of grids to web pages: </P>
<P>Although the content is not necessarily bound by a page size, the DISPLAY is 
- and that is the key to good website design. </P>
<P>In addition, the ability to combine scrolling/flowing and static elements 
allows the designer to subtly reinforce the grid as the content changes. </P>
<P>People from the print side of graphics tend to view the grid as a “foundation 
layer” onto which graphic elements are pasted. It is more useful in web 
applications to view the grid more “cinematically” as a mask or screen (or 
series of scrims) through which the user views dynamic content. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Also: your description of how you acheived the red rectangles is a bit 
misleading/imprecise. </P>
<P>The red rectangles do not have the same proportions as each single page. They 
are narrower. </P>
<P>The imaginary rectangle enclosing both red rectangles and their inner 
gutters(across the 2-page spread) has the same proportions as the entire 2-page 
spread. </P>
<P>It is interesting to me that your use of phi only starts within these 
(somewhat arbitrary) red rectangles. So on a solidly filled page of text and 
graphics, the major design proportion is still your arbitrary selection of of 
that red rectangle out of many possibilities. </P>
<P>Why not use phi to divide the page or the spread initially into active and 
marginal areas? </P>
<P>Isn’t the standardization on A4 page sizes supposed to allow relation of the 
entire grid to the golden section, or to the family of square-root-of-2 
rectangles? </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Ben-David</STRONG> - Let me first address your first comment post. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Although the content is not necessarily bound by a page size, the DISPLAY 
  is - and that is the key to good website design.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I disagree. The ‘canvas’ isn’t the display at all, the canvas is the browser 
window- the user can of course resize this to any dimension they choose. The 
canvas is also different on different media types, from PDA’s and mobile phones 
to Screenreaders. </P>
<P>I’m not too sure about your cinematic comment there. </P>
<P>Your second comment: </P>
<P>You could of course use Phi to divide the page, but for this example I chose 
not to. This article is very much a second part to the first )if you’ve read 
that) and shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a single article. </P>
<P>The standardization of A4, I dont think, is related to the Golden Section, 
but (like you say) to square root of 2. </P>
<P>Let me just say that this article isn’t supposed to be a definitive guide on 
how to create a grid for A4. It’s just a quick (simple steps) post to explain 
some of the theory which goes into grid system design. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->
