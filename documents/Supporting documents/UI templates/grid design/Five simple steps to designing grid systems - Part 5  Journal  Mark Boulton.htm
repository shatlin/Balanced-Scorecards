<P>It's been a while, but this is the final part in my series 'Five Simple Steps 
to designing Grid Systems'. </P>
<P>Flexible vs Fixed. Which one to choose? Why choose one over the other? Well 
you won't find the answers to those questions here. What I'm aiming to do with 
this article is to investigate how the theory of grid design can be applied to a 
flexible web page.</P>
<P>Lets's start by briefly examining Fixed and Flexible, or Fluid designs.</P>
<P></P>
<P>They both have their merits. </P>
<P>Fixed width designs are, well, just easier to produce. The designer has 
control over the measure, and therefore the legibility (until the user increases 
or decreases the font size that is). </P>
<P>Flexible width designs scale to the user's resolution, and therefore the 
browser window. There is less empty space, typically at the side of fixed width 
designs.</P>
<P>However, they both also have the down sides such as fixed layouts generally 
scale badly and flexible layouts tend to look very wide and short. But, this 
article is not about the good and the bad and it's not really the place for that 
type of discussion, that argument is going on elsewhere and will continue to do 
so for quite some time.</P>
<H3>Flexible grids</H3>
<P>As discussed the first few parts of this series, grid system design deals in 
fixed measurements - the media size, the type size and ultimately the grid size. 
They are all fixed. So, along comes the Web and challenges theory which has been 
around for generations. All of a sudden the reader can resize the media, they 
can change the font size, they can do all this stuff that designers didn't have 
to think about before. Designers have had to adapt, both to the technology and 
to the opportunities that media offers.</P>
<P>I've been giving flexible width a lot of thought over the past few weeks in 
preparation for writing this article. I can see the merits in both, but I've 
been trying to base my recent thought within the realms of purest grid theory. 
How does that theory translate to flexible grid design? and I think the answer 
is, quite well actually.</P>
<H3>Adaptive Grid Systems</H3>
<P>Ideally grid systems should be designed around the type size. Column widths, 
and therefore the Measure, should be constructed in such a way to maximise 
legibility based on the number of characters (you can read more about that in my 
Five Simple Steps to Better Typography). This is all fine if the units of 
measurements are fixed, but what if they can change? But what does that 
mean?</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The user can change the font size 
  <LI>The user can resize the browser window 
  <LI>The user can change their resolution </LI></OL>
<P>The user can of course do this with all design, fixed or flexible, but the 
key to flexible grid systems is the <EM>grid must adapt</EM> to those changes. 
After a bit of thought I think the key components of an adaptive grid are:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The grid elements adapt to the user's changes, and 
  <LI>The grid must retain it's orginal proportions </LI></OL>
<P>I've never been comfortable with the desciptions of flexible grids - 
flexible, elastic etc. What I'm trying to convey with <EM>Adaptive Grid Systems 
or Adaptive Layouts</EM> is the thought process behind the grid design which 
reacts to the <EM>user's choices</EM>. I think it appeals to the purist in me! 
;)</P>
<H3>It's a question of ratios. Again.</H3>
<P>In the first two parts of this series, I talked about ratios, both rational 
and irrational, in the construction of grid system design. But, for those who 
haven't read them, or have forgotten, here's a quick overview.</P>
<P>Grid systems can be constructed from ratios. Simple ratios such as 1:3, or 
2:1 are called <EM>rational</EM> ratios. More complex ratios, such as those 
based on the Golden Section (1: 1.618) , are called <EM>irrational</EM> 
ratios.</P>
<P>Ratios are just the job for constructing adaptive grid systems because they 
are independent of any unit of measurement. They are just a ratio to the whole, 
whatever the whole may be. This whole, be a browser window or whatever, can 
change and therefore so does the ratio or the grid. </P>
<P>Let me put this into practice now with a working grid.</P>
<H3>Divine measurements</H3>
<P>If you've been following these articles, you should know by now that I like 
to start simple. Following on from several articles I've written about the 
golden section, I'll continue with that and construct this adaptive grid using 
the Golden Section which is an irrational ratio - 1:1.618.</P>
<P>So first off we construct a simple two column grid system with the content 
areas being defined by the Golden Section ratio.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=364 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 5  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/adaptive_grid_1.gif" 
width=482></P>
<H3>Getting the right units</H3>
<P>In order for a grid to be adaptive, we have to use scalable units of 
measurement such as 100% or Ems. Just a reminder: An Em (pronounced 'm' NOT 'e, 
m') is a typographic measurement equal to the point size of the typeface you are 
using. We also use percentages.</P>
<P>To give us our column width I convert the ratio's to percentages, which gives 
us 61.8% for the main column and 38.2% for the right column.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=364 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 5  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/adaptive_grid_2.gif" 
width=482></P>
<P>That's our grid as determined by percentages. Pretty easy really. Now, on to 
the implementation.</P>
<H3>Constructing the grid in CSS</H3>
<P>Before I move headlong into implementing this using CSS, I just wanted to 
point out that this tutorial is about grid design and not about web standards. 
XHTML and CSS just happens to be the tools I use to realise this design. You can 
of course use tables if you want (but you'd be wrong!). Oh, and I'm just not 
clever enough to stuff this example full of hacks for IE this, Mac that, weird 
linux browser version 0.6.1 etc. etc. This example is a Best Case Scenario 
example. If you want to add all that stuff to it, let me know and I'll add it. 
Like I said, it's the grid that interests me. Disclaimer over. </P>
<P>Oh, and there's a small change to the percentages of the columns to get round 
some browser bug or another, it's basically a couple of percentage smaller so 
the floats work correctly.</P>
<P>For those who can't be bothered going through this code, here's the <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/examples/golden_section.html">example</A>.</P>
<P>Here's the CSS, including all the global stuff such as links, typographic 
stuff and general body stuff which is applied to a pretty basic XHTML 
structure.</P><PRE>body {
	margin: 0 auto;
	padding: 0;
	font-family: "Lucida Grande", verdana, arial, 
helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 62.5%;
	color: #333;
	background-color: #f0f0f0;
	text-align: center;
}

* {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
}

/* Make sure the table cells show the right font */
td { font-family: "Lucida Grande", verdana, arial, 
helvetica, sans-serif; }

/*--------------------------------------
GLOBALS &amp; GENERAL CASES
---------------------------------------*/

a {text-decoration: underline; padding: 1px; }
a:link { color: #03c; }
a:visited { color: #03c; }
a:hover { color: #fff; background-color: #30c; 
text-decoration: none; }


/*--------------------------------------
TYPOGRAPHY
---------------------------------------*/
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
        font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif;
        font-weight: normal;
}

/* approx 21px*/
h1 {
        font-size: 2.1em;
        margin-top: 2em; 
}

/* approx 16px*/
h2 {
        font-size: 1.6em;
        margin-bottom: 1em; 
}

/* approx 14px*/
h3 {
        font-size: 1.4em;
}

/* approx 12px*/
h4 {
        font-size: 1.2em;
}

/* approx 11/14 */
p {
	font-size: 1.1em;
	line-height: 1.4em;
	padding: 0;
	margin-bottom: 1em;
}
</PRE>
<P>I then add the page structure css.</P>
<P>The columns are wrapped with a container div (called 'container'), this is 
defined as being 90% wide, with a minimum width of 84 em. What's that about? 
Well I got that number by doing this.</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier, our ideal minimum width for the measure is 52 em. This 
is the width of our main column and as determined by the Golden Section, the 
overall column widths combined is 1.62 multiplied by 52 em, which is 84 em. The 
right column is therefore 84 em minus 52 em, which is 32 em. Converting these to 
percentages gives us 62% and 38%, which is what you use in the CSS for each 
column.</P>
<P>There is also a minimum width of 84 em applied to the overall container, 
which when the user resizes the text, maintains the ratios.</P>
<P>Here's the CSS for the columns:</P><PRE>#container {
	width:90%;
	margin:0 auto;
	text-align: left;
	min-width: 84em;
}

#contentframe {
	margin: 2em 0 0 0;
	padding: 2em 0;
	width: 100%;
	text-align: left;
	float: left;
	border: 1px solid #ccc;
	background-color: #fff;
}

/* 2 column layout c1-c1-c2 */
.c1-c2 #c2 {
	float: right;
	width: 36.2%;
	padding: 0 0 0 1em;
	margin: 0;
}

.c1-c2 #c1 {
	float: left;
	width: 61.8%;
	padding: 0 0 0 1em;
	margin: 0;
}
</PRE>
<P>So, there we have it. <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/examples/golden_section.html">An Adaptive 
Grid System based on the Golden Section.</A></P>
<P>Please feel free to abuse the hell out of this layout. Push it, stretch it, 
batter it into submission. Please let me know though what your findings are. Are 
Adaptive Layouts the way forward in flexible grid design for the web. Like I 
said, I'm interested in the grid, not necessarily in the implementation.</P>
<H3>That wraps up another series</H3>
<P>Well, there we are. Another series finished with. Hope you liked it, and 
thanks for all the comments and feedback. I've got a feeling this one's going to 
be interesting...</P>
<P>This is the fifth, and final, installment of this "Simple Steps..."

<P>I must say that, although I love this whole series, this installment wasn’t 
as informative as the other four. As much as it you stress the grid over the 
implementation, it seemed to be more of an exercise in <EM>building</EM> a 
flexible grid with CSS rather than the <EM>concepts</EM> of a flexible grid. 
</P>
<P>I would have liked to hear more of your thoughts about the impact of certain 
size relationships when the grid is adaptive. None of that is to discount the 
value of what you’ve written; I just believe that there’s more we can all learn 
from you about this specific topic, especially from the merit of the past four.

<P>Excelent article. It has been a pleasure following the series. <BR>Just an 
issue on the example, though; on Firefox (1.0.6 on Linux, FWIW), the right 
column “sinks” in every font size from “Normal” up; down is OK. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Dan</STRONG> - I’m afraid that was always going to be the case with 
this last part. Flexible, or Adaptive grids have been around for, what, maybe a 
few years? Fixed grids have been around centuries. I’m afraid I don’t have all 
the answers, in fact I may well have asked more than answered with this 
installment. </P>
<P>Adaptive grid systems are a relatively new direction in grid system design. 
In fact, I’m not sure if anything else has been written about them. So, I think 
this will be only the first few steps into fully understanding the theory begind 
them. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Mark I was looking forward to this article as I am a big fan of elastic 
design using em as the only unit of measure (except for images). </P>
<P>I found your combination of fluid and elastic interesting, but on past 
experience it is a very difficult path fraught with danger (like your columns 
self destructing at certain font sizes). </P>
<P>If you want to see your golden grid used in an elastic design where the line 
length is fixed, but the font size and page width varies according to your 
browser width, <A href="http://nickcowie.com/other/golden_section.html" 
target=_blank>try my variation</A>. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Nick</STRONG> - That’s a really interesting solution. I know the 
realisation of adaptive grid systems was going to be fraught with difficulty, 
not only the theory involved, but also the browser implementation. </P>
<P>The only issues I can see with the adaptive layout you’ve built is it’s not 
common browser behaviour, and therefore the user could be confused with resizing 
of the text. </P>
<P>Also, there seems to be a wee bug. When you resize the text manually, then 
try and resize the browser window, it all goes a bit screwy. That’s in Safari 
btw. </P>
<P>Bugs aside, a really interesting direction in adaptive layouts. Thanks Nick.

<P>Mark </P>
<P>The changing font size based on browser is a little radical, and might have 
problems when your font size is much larger than default (I could not get any 
real screwy behaviour with Safari 1.3, Firefox or even IE 5 on a PC.) </P>
<P>All versions of the grid on the web have problems. </P>
<P>Fixed in pixels, does not allow IE users to change font size (bad 
accessibility/usability and in other browsers look damn weird when the font size 
is increased. </P>
<P>Fluid design (% of browser width) can self destruct at small widths and at 
large widths be impossible to read.&nbsp; My 1280px screen is 180 characters 
wide at 10 px. </P>
<P>Elastic design, fixing the width to the best reading line length is only way 
to go in my opinion. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Thanks for a great series, it’s been very helpful! You may want to proofread 
it again; some sentences don’t flow fluently or seem to quit in the middle. 
Also, as Nick says, your example doesn’t work in some browsers in some font 
sizes (mine: Mac Firefox at 1024x768). Otherwise, nice work, I learned a lot 
again! </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Interesting series, you’ve taught me I need to pay closer attention to my 
grids, thanks! </P>
<P>Like Nick, I too was expecting the columns to adapt as the text was scaled?

<P>I like the article. I guess there is a great deal more to say about this. It 
is very hard for us designers to give up control, like Mark said in previous 
articles. So the flexible layout are a solution. Stretch it from 800 to 1024 px 
is not such a problem. But how far do you want to go? Is a design made for 1024 
px suitable for a mobile phone? In the future we may go back to diferent designs 
for different sizes / media when the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries</A> are fully 
implemented. </P>
<P>Take a look at <A 
href="http://www.rammstein.com/">[url=http://www.rammstein.com]http://www.rammstein.com</A>[/url] 
and resize your browser. You will see the design change. Now view it on your 
mobile phone, you will yet see another design (if you have Opera 8, view it in 
Opera and press Shift + F11 to view it small screen. The Opera homepage is a 
good example too). </P>
<P>So what is the path we should follow? I don’t know. But there will be some 
more discussion, technical innovation and user acceptance. And the future 
ofcourse, which is hard to predict. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>It seems that a big hack is needed to to cope with the w3c box model (which 
in my opinion is completley wrong and IEs model should have been adopted). </P>
<P>You have to guestimate % amounts for your margin and padding ems so the boxes 
aren’t larger than you think.&nbsp; eg, c1 has to be 62% - (margin_ems + 
padding_ems).&nbsp; Am I missing something? </P>
<P>Shudder.&nbsp; When do you ever want the internal measurements of a 
box?&nbsp; In my experience at least, you want a box that fills X amount of 
space.&nbsp; And to calculate that you have to take account of all the other 
little bits and pieces in your css. </P>

<P>The 62.5% percent font-size is there in order to having managable numbers 
</P>
<P>“BODY {font-size:62.5%} </P>
<P>This takes 16px down to 10px, which apart from being less huge is a nice 
round number. From now on it?s easy to think in pixels but still set sizes in 
terms of ems: 1em is 10px, 0.8em is 8px, 1.6em is 16px, etc. “ </P>

a graphic designer from near Cardiff in the UK. I've been a designer for over 
ten years now and primarily work on the web. I'm still partial to a bit of print 
every now and then though. I used to work for <A

working as a Senior Designer for the <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</A> in

design consultancy, <A href="http://www.markboultondesign.com/">Mark Boulton
