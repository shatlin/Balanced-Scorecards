<P>The third installment to this series is going to be a little different. The 
previous installments have been talking through some of the basics of grid 
construction using ratios as the primary device. They've also dealt with grid 
construction for print media. Unfortunately, as designers for web media, we 
don't have some of the luxuries as our print designer collegues.</P>
<P>Rather than go through tutorials (I'll be covering these in the last two 
installments), I'll be using this installment as a platform to discuss some of 
the challenges and rewards of designing grid systems for the web.</P>
<H3>A whole load of considerations</H3>
<P>Designing grid systems for print is considerably more straight forward than 
designing grid systems for the web. First off,in print, the designer has a 
<EM>fixed</EM> media size - the paper size (or packaging, poster, whatever). 
Let's say a print designer has designed a magazine. The reader of this magazine 
can't suddenly increase the font size if they find it difficult to read - well 
they just move it closer to their eyes I guess. This is just one consideration, 
there are more but I'm sure you get the point.</P>
<P>So, that's media size. On the web you have other considerations such as the 
browser, the OS platform, the screen size and the actual devices that web sites 
can be viewed on, from PDA's and Mobile's to assistive technologies such as 
screen readers. How do you design a grid for all of this? It's a really good 
question and I'm not claiming I have the answer.</P>
<H3>In an ideal world</H3>
<P>We all know about the problems with websites rendering differently across 
different browsers, platforms, devices etc. But, just for a moment, let's forget 
about that.</P>
<P>Designing a grid for the web should not be difficult, in fact, it shouldn't 
be any different from designing a grid for an media. As discussed in the 
previous parts of the series, you can construct a grid in the same manner for 
screen as you do for print. Base it on ratios, experiment with form and white 
space etc. Use pixels as your base measurement and go from there in the 
knowledge that your design will look exactly the same in every browser. After 
all, you, the designer, knows best for your reader right? You <EM>know</EM> they 
want light grey, 10px verdana with a measure of 600 pixels.</P>
<H3>In the real world</H3>
<P>Good designers for the web <EM>know</EM> that the users who use their sites 
may want different, and know, with the web, they have the power to change 
things. The designer has lost, to a degree, the ability to <EM>control</EM>. For 
a lot of designers (including me), this has been a tough transition. We're 
taught for years to create the delicate balances of white space, the manicured 
typography and delicate colour palettes, all designed to create harmonious 
designs which do their job very well. </P>
<P>Then some short sighted user comes along and increases the text size... 
and... and... totally breaks <EM>your</EM> design.</P>
<P>I think you get the idea. We can't be upset when the user wants to change 
something like the text size. What we can do is design grid systems to 
<EM>adapt</EM> to those changes.</P>
<H3>Not just columns</H3>
<P>Over the past couple of years, coupled with the increase in CSS based sites, 
we've seen a rise in certain grid configurations which are all based on the 
amount of columns. 2, 3, 4 column layouts - float this, position that etc. Why, 
even this site falls into the '750 px, 3 column' category. These grids have 
quickly become a convention, and for good reason too. They are quick to create, 
fairly stable across many platforms and don't degrade to the same degree as 
table based layouts. This is all good. What isn't so good though is the general 
lack of understanding of grid systems when perhaps the question on most 
designers lips when they sit down to begin a design is, 'how many columns should 
I have'. This is not grid system design.</P>
<H3>Grid systems for the web</H3>
<P>The next two installments of this series will go through details of creating 
considered grid systems for the web and the implementation using CSS. I thought 
it would be useful to just go through some of the considerations before 
hand.</P>
<H3>The series</H3>
<P>This is the third installment of this "Simple Steps..." series.</P>

<P>Great articles. </P>
<P>I would suggest though that you toss in links to your previous articles. I 
just found this today and part 1 is going to fall off your list of recent 
articles soon. Maybe a little summary “In <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_1/">Part 
1</A> we talked about...” This way I don’t have to go hunting for the previous 
pieces when they fall off the list of recent articles. It may also be a good 
idea to create a “Series” category to make it easier to follow series of posts… 
assuming you plan to do more (and I hope you do). </P>
<P>Keep up the good work!! </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Not much content here to say much about; hardly an article. But a few 
thoughtful points were raised: the web is not only the ultimate democratizer for 
information, but it’s starting to be that for visual design (with RSS, databases 
holding info, google caches, etc). </P>
<P>This lack of control seems to be OK with many, but the designer’s task is to 
shape information; we are the facilitators between content experts and the 
layperson, people rely on our experience to be able to control the flow of 
information so that people will better understand it. Releasing this control is 
harmful to the information and the reader as some things will be lost in 
translation. After all, we’re now familiar with the content and can make sound 
decisions about placement, size, color, pace, tone, flow, etc. How can someone 
uninitiated to the content make reasonable decisions about this? I just don’t 
buy the ‘designers should let go of control because we’re on the web now’ 
argument; it’s not based on any sound footing from the content’s perspective. 
</P>
<P>Also, the learning curve to publish on the web is very low compared to print; 
this has created a very large population of designers that have no foundation in 
size &amp; scale, pace and position. Enter template and copy/paste xhtml code 
design. </P>
<P>Thankfully there’s a core of people interested in pushing the bounds of the 
*visual* (not simply xhtml/css code). </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>dmr</STRONG> - My point with this post was to raise the questions, 
not to answer any really. </P>
<P>I think you misunderstand my points though. You said: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>How can someone uninitiated to the content make reasonable decisions about 
  this? I just don?t buy the ?designers should let go of control because we?re 
  on the web now? argument; it?s not based on any sound footing from the 
  content?s perspective.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Let me answer the first question. Why should the user <EM>care</EM> how the 
content is arranged as long as they can access/read it? Maybe that’s the reason 
we have so much ‘undesigned’ content on the web. It’s because people generally 
don’t care as long as they can fulfil a task or read some content. <STRONG>They 
<EM>do not</EM> have to be ‘initiated’ to read what they want to read.</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>The second point. If you read the post again, my point was more about 
scalability, not control. I’m not sure I understand your point about content in 
this context. </P>
<P>Also, I disagree with your point about web/print learning curve. After doing 
both for many years I’m still very much on the curve for producing good design 
for the web. This, I guess, is due to it’s fluidity as a medium - you don’t 
really get that with print. Also, the majority of print work isn’t <EM>used</EM> 
in the same way web sites and applications are. And that’s the point really. I’m 
not just talking about text based websites here, I’m talking about applications 
too. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<DIV class=commentcontent>
<P>Content is key. As designers we should ensure that the content is available 
to as many people as possible. Surely, it the role of the designer to adapt 
their skills to allow for this level of flexibilty. A default design may still 
be created, but if this design crashes simply because a user wants the text size 
a bit bigger, then the design is flawed. The beauty of designing with standards 
allows for flexibilty: alternate style sheets, high contrast views, zoom layouts 
etc. Therefore, the designer should not just let go of the control, but actively 
hand control to the user. Thus a good web designer, you may come. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 3  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/mark_boulton.jpg">I'm 
a graphic designer from near Cardiff in the UK. I've been a designer for over 
ten years now and primarily work on the web. I'm still partial to a bit of print 
every now and then though. I used to work for <A 
href="http://www.agency.com/">Agency.com</A> in London as an Art Director before 
working as a Senior Designer for the <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</A> in 
sunny Cardiff. This was all before I took leave of my senses and formed my own 
design consultancy, <A href="http://www.markboultondesign.com/">Mark Boulton 
Design Ltd.</A></P>
<P>I've got a thing about grids and typography and occasionally <A 
href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive">ramble on</A> <A 
href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2007/europe/">about them</A> to anyone who 
will listen.</P></DIV>
