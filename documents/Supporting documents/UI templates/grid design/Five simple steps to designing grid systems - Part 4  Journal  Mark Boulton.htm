<P>Layout seems to be a <A 
href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/is-1024-ok">hot topic</A> at the 
moment, mostly prompted by the <A href="http://www.alistapart.com/">ALA 
redesign</A> and the <A 
href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050825222234.xml">numerous</A> <A 
href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/a_list_taken_apart.html">discussions</A> 
of the choice by <A 
href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2005/08/23/a_list_apart_redesign.php">Jason</A> 
and the ALA team to go 1024 for a fixed width. I'm not going to go into my 
thoughts on ALA in too much depth here, there's <A 
href="http://www.danielmall.com/archives/2005/08/23/listed_apart.php">been a lot 
of that already</A>, but it seems like the right time to get this article 
out.</P>
<P>So, fixed width grid design for the web. What is it, how do we do it and how 
do we implement it?</P>
<P>For the purposes of this article, I'm going to be focussing on the theory of 
creating the grid rather than the implementation. I did mention in the last 
series that I would cover implementation using CSS, well I'm not going to. There 
are just <EM>so</EM> many resources and books available telling you how to 
create the CSS layouts you need—I'll touch on it, but I won't be going into too 
much detail.</P>
<H2>The Measurements</H2>
<P>A fixed grid for designing for the web is as close a translation from 
traditional grid design as there is. The designer is using fixed measurements, 
pixels mostly, to construct the grid and to position elements within the grid 
structure and a canvas which is based on a fixed size. See, everything is 
fixed.</P>
<H2>The Canvas</H2>
<P>Now things start to get a little less concrete. The canvas size for print 
design is determined by the media size - paper, signage, envelope, whatever. The 
canvas size for fixed grid design on the web is normally determined by the 
browser window size, which is in turn determined by the user's screen 
resolution. These are not fixed. Therefore a designer should design to the 
minimum requirement, which is normally the average screen resolution for the 
majority of users.</P>
<P>I'm not going to quote figures here, because I'll probably be wrong, but I 
don't think I'm wrong in saying that 800x600 pixel screen resolution has, for 
quite a few years now, been the screen resolution to design to.</P>
<P>As I mentioned, with the relaunch of ALA, and sites like <A 
href="http://www.stylegala.com/">Stylegala</A>, there has been a renewed 
discussion about fixed width grids for 1024. So, what's my opinion on this? 
Well, in terms of the actual grid design it really doesn't matter what size the 
canvas is. What should be determining the decision to go 1024 is research into 
user's screen resolutions. If the user base of a certain site is shown to be 
using resolutions of that size and above, then a decision to use that size to 
design to is a valid one.</P>
<P>However, as some people have noted, even if you do run at a higher resolution 
than 800x600 does that mean your browser window occupies the entire screen? The 
answer to this is, generally we don't know. I personally think that not only is 
it platform specific, but it's also down to the individual and their experience 
level. Maybe more experienced users on a PC don't use their browser's at full 
screen. From my experience running user tests with a wide range of people, is 
that more novice users, particularly on a PC, run a browser at full screen 
<EM>because that is the default</EM>, whereas on a Mac the default isn't full 
screen.</P>
<P>What I haven't touched on yet is the device you are using. This of course 
could be a PDA, a mobile phone or a computer. Grid designs should be looked at 
for each of these devices.</P>
<P>That is all I'm going to say on the matter for now though. Once the final 
part in this series is up, fluid grid design, there can be a more informed 
discussion I think.</P>
<H2>Nice, easy dimensions and thinking modular</H2>
<P>Without further a do, let's get into this grid design.</P>
<P>As discussed in the rest of this series (part <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_1/">1</A>, 
<A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_21/">2</A> 
and <A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_3/">3</A>), 
we will begin our grid design by '<A 
href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five_simple_steps_to_designing_grid_systems_part_21/">shaping 
the page</A>.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this simple (I am trying to keep it simple) article, I'll 
be using 800 x 600 as my default resolution to design to. For many years I've 
designed to a base minimum (based on 800 x 600) of 760px x 410px (410px being 
the fold). Don't ask me where I got these figures from, but it just stuck and 
seems to be ok for most platforms and browsers. Oh, you can of course go smaller 
than this and don't pay too much attention to the fold, in my experience most 
users don't have a problem with scrolling.</P>
<P>We begin by applying ratios to this canvas, in the same way we've done with 
designing grid system for print. The example I'm using for this tutorial is my 
own site, which uses a fixed grid and sits happily below 760px wide.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=368 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 4  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grids_4_1.gif" 
width=490></P>
<P>The design for my site is built around around a very simple grid system. Once 
I had my grid, I used photoshop to comp together the designs positioning any 
elements exactly on the grid lines. The grid was designed intially for a content 
and navigation area based on the Rule of Thirds (which is roughly approximated 
around the Golden Section), the dimensions of which are 250px and 500px 
respectively. The content area is then subdivided into two 250px columns. </P>
<P>See, nice easy dimensions. However, this only deals with horizontal 
measurement. As discussed in the other grid articles, vertical measurement is 
also important, but this is where we can run into problems with designing even 
fixed grid systems on the web.</P>
<P>When user's change the type size, elements move vertically (if we've fixed 
the horizontal widths). The vertical measurements that we've crafted suddenly 
disappear. Now, in the purist's eye, this is a real problem but it is something 
we have to design to. We really can't do anything about it when designing with 
fixed units such as pixels which can't be resized by the user.</P>
<H2>Just a word about Gutters</H2>
<P>Gutters are the gaps in between columns. They are there so text, or image, 
from different columns don't run into each other. In grid system design 
sometimes, depending on what theory you read, gutters are seperate to the 
columns. This creates practical problems for us when designing grid systems on 
the web because of the way we create the columns.</P>
<P>Generally the columns we create, using Web Standards, are 'divs' which are 
given widths and positioned and styled using CSS. So, ideally, if we're creating 
these columns, we don't want to be creating seperate ones for the gutters. We 
therefore deal with gutters as <EM>part</EM> of columns and they are implemented 
using padding, or creating margins, on elements positioned within them, or 
sometimes the column divs themselves.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=368 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 4  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grids_4_3.gif" 
width=490></P>
<H2>Creating the design</H2>
<P>The thing about designing to grids is that in order for the grid to work 
<EM>you must consistently align</EM> items on the grid lines. I know that sounds 
totally obvious but designing to strong grids means you have to take a step back 
from what you think the design should look like (and then adding things to the 
grid to suit), and instead concentrate on creating a harmonious design 
<EM>within</EM> the framework you've created.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=368 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 4  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grids_4_4.jpg" 
width=490></P>
<P>The bulk of the design work, if you exclude sketching with a pencil, is done 
in Photoshop. First of all I take great care in drawing the grid accurately, to 
the pixel, and then I overlay content elements ensuring the alignment is 
precise.</P>
<H2>From Photoshop to the browser</H2>
<P>As I stated at the beginning of this article, I'm not going to concentrate 
too much on how you actually build a multi-column CSS layout, there are just so 
many other great resources on that topic.</P>
<P>One of the most useful 'tools' for creating pixel-perfect grid systems for 
the web is <A 
href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2004/1231_grid_computi.php">Khoi's 
superb idea</A> of using a grid as a background-image element on the body tag. 
To summarise: Using the grid I designed in photoshop, I save it out as a gif and 
then apply that to the background of the body tag. This provides me, throughout 
the build of the site, the grid so I can align all the content elements 
accordingly.</P>
<P><IMG title={title} height=368 alt={title} 
src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 4  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/grids_4_5.jpg" 
width=490></P>
<P>As you can see from the diagram, this makes production of the design 
incredibly easy when you have a visual reference rather than having to remember 
your grid or interpret a sketch.</P>
<H3>Implementation using Web Standards</H3>
<P>This really could be a series all on it's own. Implementation of a 
multi-column grid using CSS is pretty standard practice nowadays, but there are 
some very useful resources out there which I have used for the past 18 months or 
so.</P>
<P>Doug Bowman at <A href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Stopdesign</A> has 
pioneered a technique for producing flexible column layouts using CSS and 
controlling them by giving a class to the body tag. This is the techique I've 
used throughout this site. This means if I create a new section of the site or 
simply decide one day that I'd rather have my navigation on the right, all I 
have to do is change the class on the body element and everything switches over. 
Using this technique, along with Khoi's technique for sense checking the design 
against the grid, has been an excellent way to produce tight, grid layouts for 
me, give it a go and let me know what you think.</P>
<H3>Up next: Fluid grid systems for the web.</H3>
<P>Timely? Yes. Complicated? Yes, but they don't have to be. Fluid, or flexible, 
grid systems have a rightful place in grid system design for the web but they 
come with their own particular set of challenges. In the next installment I'll 
be having a look at flexible grids using relational measurements and also tying 
the grid design closer to the typography rather than the browser - flexible from 
a type perspective, rather than a browser perspective. Stay tuned.</P>
<H3>The series</H3>
<P>This is the fourth installment of this "Simple Steps..." series.</P>

<P>Thanks Mark. Nice article. What I miss though is more on the idea behind the 
grid. You have told we should use a grid and how to practically do this. But I 
guess there is more to it than just a 1:2 devision. And what about the vertical 
grid? We just leave that out? </P>
<P>A bit more indepth on the actual subject, grids, would have been nice in my 
oppinion. And less about everything around it (photoshop, css ...) But hey, a 
least you writeabout it. I don’t (lazy ass ...). </P>
<P>So keep up the good work and I’ll be checking back for part 5. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Bertje</STRONG> - Have a look through the first three parts of this 
series, within those articles I talk more about the theory in designing grid 
systems with ratios. </P>
<P>With regards to this article, as I stated, vertical grid divisions, if ratio 
based are impossible to retain in a browser when the user can change the text as 
this will change the ratio. </P>
<P>There is an assumption that grid design has to be complicated, that you have 
to have hundreds of intricate boxes etc all aligned to some crazy ratios. This 
isn’t the case at all. So, yes, my initial grid is just a 1:2 ratio which is 
then subdivided. The 1:2 ratio is of course based on the Rule of Thirds, which 
is a similar ratio to the Golden Section. So, what may look extremely simple, 
has been thought out quite a lot. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>I like the fact that you are focusing on theory rather than implementation 
details, we could use more articles like that. </P>
<P>However, this is the comments section, and I have an implementation question 
;) </P>
<P>While, as you mention, there are plenty of multicolumn CSS tutorials out 
there, I’m not sure they would support your design: if you have three columns 
(with a div per column), how do you keep items in column one aligned with items 
in columns two and three (as happens in your example)? It seems like there needs 
to be some artificial height limitations on the content in order to do that. 
</P>
<P>Looking at your home page, that seems to be the case. However, if I try 
adding some longer text to one of the portfolio sections, fort example, it 
overlaps the content below it in an ugly way. Not very flexible. </P>
<P>And if you approach it with nested divs to avoid that problem (outer 
divs=rows, inner divs=cols), might you not as well just use tables? </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Mark, </P>
<P>This Simple Steps series is BRILLIANT. I’m salivating for the next article. 
</P>
<P>A question about gutters: </P>
<P>I see the graphics and text in the third and fifth columns ("BBC Vocab” and 
“Cube Gallery") do not honour the gutter. Every other element does (save, “skip 
to content” and accessibility icons). Is there a reason for this? </P>

<P>Great article.&nbsp; About 2 weeks ago, I pretty much re-designed my site 
verbatim as you described, gutters and all, but before your article came out (do 
I get a prize?). </P>
<P>My actual container div is 760px wide, but the columns inside are each 250px, 
with a gutter of 10px each, and some extra 10px space on the right side of the 
container (to balance out the 10px from the gutter on the left side). </P>
<P>@MH: I’ve done some fake columns on my site, if you want to check them 
out.&nbsp; I used the footer to cap them off, and a container background to 
simulate them.&nbsp; For a full writeup on how to do fake columns, check out 
this article… </P>
<P>† <A 
href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns</A> 
</P>
<P>I say all that not to draw attention to myself, but as a testament to Mark’s 
excellent writeup.&nbsp; These design principles are very solid.&nbsp; I suppose 
I could be like the guy from the Hair Club for Men commercial, saying “It worked 
for me!” </P>
<P>I love the concept-based approach to this tutorial.&nbsp; I hope you feel 
better soon and that there are many more articles like this (and more related to 
typography) on the way. </P>
<P>By the way, I love the JavaScripton the comment form, that offers more 
informative tips.&nbsp; Very, very nice touch. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>I *heart* this series. =D </P>
<P>Being a web author who dare/has to take care of some small sites’ graphic 
design, I can really appreciate the value of articles like these. </P>
<P>I mean, when I started to design, I hadn’t a solid graphic background, so 
mastering concepts like grid system in web design took reaaally a lot of time to 
me. </P>
<P>If I had articles like these handy at that time, I guess I could have 
sensibly shortened my learning curve to proper designing :) </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Gutters by Ratio</STRONG> <BR>Hey Mark, <BR>I’m wondering about using 
ratios for the gutters on columns. The example you used in part 1 of the series 
showed a complex grid with what could be construed as gutters on the edges of 
wider main columns. </P>
<P>Is there a reason to use an arbitrary gutter width instead of basing it upon 
the same ratios as the rest of the page? </P>
<P>Great series, by the way. Thanks for sharing these insights in such a concise 
and readable way. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG> - Normally , I like to base gutter width on type 
size that way there is a relationship between the type and gutter (I normally 
put the gutter at anywhere between 3 and 6em, this generally depends on the 
typeface I’m using - Sans Serif need more space than Serifs - generally). </P>
<P>Gutter created by ratio is also another solution. Arbitrary widths are also 
fine, but on closer inspection you can bet these arbitrary measurements are 
close to ratios or em measurements. :) </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>I was wondering… </P>
<P>Are you considering doing a book about it? It wouldn’t have to be a really 
big book (do you ever wonder as I do why computer related books have to be so 
big? Something to do with the male ego? lol!)… </P>
<P>It could be a pdf book (maybe not as good looking as this <A 
href="http://www.sinelogic.com/">one</A> but hopefully with less hype and more 
content), with raw files - a tutorial kit kind of thing, that would get you from 
start to finish on how to design a sample web page with grids (a bit like the 
last chapter of Bullet Proof Web Design - but with design in mind). </P>
<P>I for one am dying for it (as can be shamelessly seen <A

I am no designer! </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>One step ahead of you there Jamal ;) Expect to see a book, in one form or 
another, in the next few months. </P>
<P>After reading your post on Molly’s site, I do see your point and frustration. 
There’s a lot of stuff around which shows designers how to build something 
technically, but nothing aimed at the reverse market. </P>
<P>Maybe that’s designer’s thinking we’re a bit ‘special’ eh? </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Oh… You mean the elitist designers’ club? Those people? The Sect? </P>
<P>The one you’re accepted into if only you do know by heart <A

(since he also says <A href="http://www.penandthink.com/niggle/about/">“I am no 
designer”</A> (well he does say he is after all so I don’t know if he can join) 
- the club’s motto. </P>
<P>I think design is truly about perception - can you teach that? Hope so… Just 
point me to the right book! </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Thanks. If you haven’t studied design (like me) then this kind of article is 
a great help - I lived with designers through university and read a few books, 
although they are detailed etc, none of them deliver what I want to know as 
directly as this series of artices. - a great idea well executed. </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

<P>Just one more hint: a “classic” grid is based on the font and font size as 
its smallest unit. </P>
<P>Step 1: Choose font and font size (e.g. Verdana, 11 px) <BR>Step 2: Choose 
line spacing (e.g. 140%) <BR>Step 3: Define column width (e.g. 40 characters) 
<BR>Step 4: Define gutter (e.g. 14 px) <BR>Step 5: Define module size (based on 
line spacing and column width) </P></DIV><!-- author information -->

src="Five simple steps to designing grid systems - Part 4  Journal  Mark Boulton_files/mark_boulton.jpg">I'm 
a graphic designer from near Cardiff in the UK. I've been a designer for over 
ten years now and primarily work on the web. I'm still partial to a bit of print 
every now and then though. I used to work for <A 
href="http://www.agency.com/">Agency.com</A> in London as an Art Director before 
working as a Senior Designer for the <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</A> in 
sunny Cardiff. This was all before I took leave of my senses and formed my own 
design consultancy, <A href="http://www.markboultondesign.com/">Mark Boulton 
Design Ltd.</A></P>
<P>I've got a thing about grids and typography and occasionally <A 
href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive">ramble on</A> <A 
href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2007/europe/">about them</A> to anyone who 
will listen.</P></DIV>
